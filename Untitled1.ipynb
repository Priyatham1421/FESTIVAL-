It's possible that executing this string within the `exec` call isn't properly making `math.factorial` or the `factorial` function defined within it available in the global scope. I will try a different approach to define the functions directly using `eval()` or by breaking down the code execution. Since `eval()` is generally not recommended for arbitrary code, I'll define the functions in separate `code_block` calls to ensure they are properly registered in the environment before testing.\n",

        "*   The first refined prompt, which specified usage and rate parameters and a basic calculation formula, led to the generation of a functional code snippet performing a simple multiplication.\n",
        "*   The second refined prompt, adding a fixed charge parameter and updating the calculation formula, resulted in more comprehensive code that included the fixed charge in the calculation.\n",
        "*   Each step of prompt refinement directly led to increasingly specific and functional Python code, demonstrating the importance of detailed prompts for achieving desired AI output.\n",
